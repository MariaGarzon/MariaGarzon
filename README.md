Originally, I graduated in Biochemistry and Philosophy... the transition to Bioinformatics was not quite immediate, and it only took a global pandemic to finally get me to sit down for hours. Ironically, the fact that my field of studies was a little unrelated to Data Science helped me a lot in this process. It obliged me to give nothing for granted, roll up my sleeves and start a brand new learning journey. Good thing is, so far, it has been a real BLAST!

When I am not contemplating genetic sequences, among others, you might find me reading, running, cooking, or rather eating and finding inspiration in a nice glass of dry wine (my favorites change too often).
