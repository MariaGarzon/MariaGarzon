Originally, I graduated in Biochem & Philosophy... the jump to Bioinformatics was not quite immediate and it only took a world pandemic to get me sitting for hours. Ironically, the fact that my field of studies was a little unrelated to Data Science helped me a lot in this process. It obliged me to give nothing for granted, roll up my sleeves and start a brand new learning journey. Good thing is, so far, it has been a real BLAST!

When I am not contemplating genetic sequences, among others, you might find me reading, running, cooking, or rather eating and finding inspiration in a nice glass of dry wine (my favorites change too often).
