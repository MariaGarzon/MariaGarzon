Originally, I graduated in Biology and spent almost one year playing around with lawyerâ€™s bank statements as an accountant. The jump to Data Science was not quite immediate. Ironically, the fact that my field of studies had been completely unrelated to Data Science helped me a lot in this process. It obliged me to give nothing for granted, roll up my sleeves and start a brand new learning journey. Good thing is, so far, it has been a real blast!

When I am not contemplating a Jupyter Notebook you might find me running, cooking, or rather eating some good Belgian chocolate and finding inspiration in a nice glass of dry wine (my favorites change too often).
